## Usage with FastMCP

### Starting the Server

```bash
python postgresql_server.py
```

### LLM Integration Examples

The LLM can interact with the PostgreSQL MCP server through natural language:

#### 1. Database Connection

**User:** "Connect to my local PostgreSQL database"
**Tool Call:** `connect_database`

```json
{
  "connection_id": "local_gis",
  "host": "localhost",
  "database": "geospatial_db",
  "username": "gis_user",
  "password": "password123",
  "port": 5432,
  "ssl": false
}
```

#### 2. Complex Spatial Analysis

**User:** "Find all restaurants within 500 meters of downtown"
**Tool Call:** `execute_spatial_query`

```json
{
  "connection_id": "local_gis",
  "query": "SELECT name, address, ST_Distance(location, ST_GeomFromText('POINT(-122.4194 37.7749)', 4326)) as distance FROM buildings WHERE building_type = 'restaurant' AND ST_DWithin(location, ST_GeomFromText('POINT(-122.4194 37.7749)', 4326), 500) ORDER BY distance",
  "geometry_format": "WKT"
}
```

#### 3. Parametric Data Operations

**User:** "Add a new hospital to the database"
**Tool Call:** `insert_record`

```json
{
  "connection_id": "local_gis",
  "table_name": "buildings",
  "data": {
    "name": "Central General Hospital",
    "address": "123 Medical Center Dr",
    "building_type": "hospital",
    "location": "POINT(-122.4194 37.7749)",
    "capacity": 500
  }
}
```

#### 4. Advanced Geospatial Queries

**User:** "Calculate population density by neighborhood"
**Tool Call:** `execute_select_query`

```json
{
  "connection_id": "local_gis",
  "query": "SELECT n.name as neighborhood, COUNT(b.id) as building_count, SUM(b.estimated_population) as total_population, ST_Area(n.geometry) / 1000000 as area_sq_km, (SUM(b.estimated_population) / (ST_Area(n.geometry) / 1000000)) as density_per_sq_km FROM neighborhoods n LEFT JOIN buildings b ON ST_Within(b.location, n.geometry) GROUP BY n.name, n.geometry HAVING COUNT(b.id) > 0 ORDER BY density_per_sq_km DESC",
  "limit": 20
}
```

## Security Features

### Query Safety Validation

- Only SELECT queries allowed for `execute_select_query`
- Automatic detection of dangerous SQL keywords
- Parameterized queries prevent SQL injection

### Connection Security

- SSL support for encrypted connections
- Secure credential handling
- Connection pooling and cleanup

### Data Protection

- Read-only operations for complex queries
- Explicit CRUD operations with validation
- Transaction rollback on errors

## PostGIS Functions Supported

The server supports all PostGIS functions including:

- **Spatial Relationships**: `ST_Contains`, `ST_Within`, `ST_Intersects`
- **Distance Analysis**: `ST_Distance`, `ST_DWithin`, `ST_Buffer`
- **Geometry Operations**: `ST_Union`, `ST_Intersection`, `ST_Difference`
- **Coordinate Systems**: `ST_Transform`, `ST_SetSRID`
- **Geometry Creation**: `ST_GeomFromText`, `ST_MakePoint`
- **Spatial Analysis**: `ST_Area`, `ST_Length`, `ST_Centroid`

## Integration with Arion

This FastMCP server integrates seamlessly with Arion's PostgreSQL integration:

1. **UI Configuration**: Use Arion's UI to configure database connections
2. **MCP Access**: LLM can access the same databases through this MCP server
3. **Shared Security**: Uses the same credential management system
4. **Unified Experience**: Seamless integration between UI and LLM operations

### Configuration in Arion

Add this MCP server to your Arion configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "postgresql": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["postgresql_server.py"],
      "cwd": "/path/to/mcp-servers/postgresql"
    }
  }
}
```

## Error Handling

The server provides comprehensive error handling:

- Connection failures with detailed messages
- SQL syntax error reporting
- Security violation warnings
- Transaction rollback on failures

## Logging

All operations are logged with appropriate levels:

- INFO: Successful operations
- ERROR: Failures and exceptions
- DEBUG: Query execution details (in development)

## Natural Language Examples

The LLM can handle these types of requests:

### Spatial Analysis

- _"Find all buildings within 1km of the city center"_
- _"Calculate the area of all parks in the downtown district"_
- _"Show me the nearest hospital to coordinates [lat, lng]"_
- _"Find optimal locations for new fire stations"_

### Data Management

- _"Add a new school to the database at these coordinates"_
- _"Update all residential buildings to include flood risk data"_
- _"Delete all temporary construction sites from last month"_
- _"Show me the structure of the spatial_data table"_

### Business Intelligence

- _"Calculate population density by neighborhood"_
- _"Find areas with high commercial activity but low residential density"_
- _"Analyze traffic patterns near shopping centers"_
- _"Generate a report of all building permits issued this year"_
